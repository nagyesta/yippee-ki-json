# Security Policy

## Err on the safer side

As Yippee-Ki-JSON is strictly intended to be desktop application, running in a command line, it is **strongly recommended to never use any
Yippee-Ki-JSON artifacts in any other scenario e.g. as part of a web application**. This can simplify things and rule out a number of
threats strongly connected to web use. Although this is not ensuring that it won't be ever a source you would need to consider as a source
of risk, it would certainly make it a bit harder to use for malicious actors.

## Supported Versions

The aim is to support the end users kindly trusting this library as much as possible but at the end of the day, this is a hobby project
which maintained in my free time. So reality is that the latest version will be supported with security patches in case vulnerabilities are
reported and everything else will be decided case by case.

[![Supported version](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/nagyesta/yippee-ki-json?color=green&logo=git&label=Supported%20version&sort=semver)](https://img.shields.io/github/v/tag/nagyesta/yippee-ki-json?color=green&logo=git&label=Supported%20version&sort=semver)
