Here you can find all Predicates defined as part of the standard package.

## How to use this document...

Predicates have a single purpose of evaluating input values and returning boolean values. This might or might not need
any additional configuration as you will see form our examples.

Each predicate has a **version** when it was added to the app, a **class** implementing them, a **name** they are 
registered with, an **input type**, a **parameter** list defining how they can be configured, a **description** stating
what they are supposed to do, and we will show an **example configuration** as well.
