This page lists all the existing Function implementations we ship with the app.

## How to use this document...

Each function does one simple thing, generate an output vale by applying the function to an input value.
To implement this, we can use some configuration parameters affecting the function behavior. These parameters are listed
under the configuration map of that belongs to the function under the `params` object defined for the rule which will
use the function during the transformation.

Each function has a **version** when it was added to the app, a **class** implementing them, a **name** they are 
registered with, an **input type**, an **output type**, a **parameter** list defining how they can be configured, 
a **description** stating what they are supposed to do, and we will show an **example configuration** as well.
