This page contains the bundled Suppliers implementations we offer.

## How to use this document...

Each supplier has only one purpose: supplies an output value. Even though they don't have parameters runtime, we still
need to tell them what they need to supply when they are called. This means that we must use some input parameters most
likely to control this.

Each supplier has a **version** when it was added to the app, a **class** implementing them, a **name** they are 
registered with, an **output type**, a **parameter** list defining how they can be configured, a **description** stating
what they are supposed to do, and we will show an **example configuration** as well.
